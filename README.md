# PHP-Series
Here all the PHP Code will be stored and I'm also learning PHP so It will be fun.



# PHP Series
    • In This Repo I will Store All The Java Code Which I'm Practicing and
      learning. I'll cover all the Topic like basic format format,
      operators, control statements, functions etc.

# Study Material I'm Using
    • I have 2 sets of Notes first I got from my College and Second set of notes I got
      from a YouTube Channel(Code With Harry) Both are great for learning.
    


# Note
    • I Didn't cover much thoery in Java files, for theory you can read notes, I covered 
      mostly practicle stuuf in java programming files.
